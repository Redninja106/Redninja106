I like computer graphics, compilers, game engines, and every other kind of programming

Some of my projects:
#### Graphics:
- [BlockGame](https://github.com/Redninja106/BlockGame42) (experiments with voxel raytracing, global illumination & spatial hashing) 
- [BlockGFX](https://github.com/Redninja106/BlockGFX) (older experiments with voxel raytracing, superseded by blockgame)
- [Opengl Experiments](https://github.com/Redninja106/openglexperiments) (a simple opengl renderer)
- [Raytracer](https://github.com/Redninja106/Raytracer) (A GPU-accelerated raytracer)
#### Games:
- [SimulationFramework](https://github.com/Redninja106/simulationframework)  (My coolest one, please check it out)
- [SpaceRTS](https://github.com/Redninja106/SpaceRTS) (a multiplayer, data-driven RTS game)
- [ConsoleApp17](https://github.com/Redninja106/ConsoleApp17) (an unnamed game engine+demos)
- [Torch](https://github.com/Redninja106/GMTK23) (My entry to the GMTK game jam 2023) 
- [ClothSim](https://github.com/Redninja106/ClothSim) (A little verlet integration cloth simulator)
#### Programming Languages:
- [GoClone](https://github.com/Redninja106/GoClone) (A go-like programming language)
- [SimulationFramework experimental branch](https://github.com/Redninja106/simulationframework/tree/0.2.0) (C# CIL -> GLSL compiler)
- [K](https://github.com/Redninja106/k-lang) (Programming Language, from scratch in C)
- [BridgeSharp](https://github.com/Redninja106/BridgeSharp) (llvm-inspired intermediate lang)
